OSM Buildings is a JavaScript library for visualizing OpenStreetMap building geometry on 2D and 3D maps.
This version is using a custom WebGL base map for any event and tile logic.

Example: [http://osmbuildings.org/gl/](http://osmbuildings.org/gl/?lat=40.70614&lon=-74.01039&zoom=17.00&rotation=0&tilt=40)

It is the very first public version of OSM Buildings using a WebGL renderer.

There are many known issues, performance bottlenecks and missing features.
I'm trying hard to achieve the best but always lacking time and other resources.

If you're willing to support, I'm grateful for any contribution.
Thank you very much.
